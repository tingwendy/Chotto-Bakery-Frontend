~ 🍰 🥐CHOTTO BAKERY 🍰 🥐 ~

Description: 
A full stack application built with Javascript, MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, CSS, Bootstrap, and Stripe API for payment processing. 

Inspiration:
I choose to build an application for a bakery because I wanted to combine my love for baking and coding into a project that I can continue to work on. I hope to continue adding functionalities as I practice my coding skills.

Functionalities: 
The application allows users to create an account, log in, browse, and place an order for items on the menu. 
Users can also put in a special order and upload images of ideas they want to come to life. 
Users can pay for their orders with the Stripe API.

Chotto Bakery is deployed on Heroku and Netlify.
